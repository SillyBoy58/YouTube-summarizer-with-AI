# YouTube-summarizer-with-AI
Lets you summarize YouTube videos with AI

There's like a chrome extension that can do this or something, but I don't like the privacy policies and stuff of it, also I'm just not comfortable about the extension, so I made a python app that lets you do pretty much the same thing.
