# YouTube-summarizer-with-AI
Lets you summarize YouTube videos with AI

There's like a chrome extension that can do this or something, but I don't like the privacy policies and stuff of it, also I'm just not comfortable about the extension, so I made a python app that lets you do pretty much the same thing. So far you can only run it locally via Ollama, ChatGPT AI will come sometime, maybe soon maybe not, whenever I have the time.

In "YouTube summary" install the libraries in "requirements.txt" and run "main.py"

The "Video ID" is what comes after "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=" in a YouTube URL

For example:
If the YouTube video URL is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

The ID would be: dQw4w9WgXcQ
